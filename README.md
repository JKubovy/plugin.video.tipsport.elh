# plugin.video.tipsport.elh
My long-running project is a Kodi add-on for watching sports broadcasts from Tipsport.cz. As it is not an official add-on, it needs constant development as the site from which the broadcasts are obtained changes. It is possible to monitor and report problems with the add-on if necessary at [xbmc-kodi.cz](https://www.xbmc-kodi.cz/prispevek-doplnek-tipsport-elh?action=lastpost). Another option is to use [Issues](https://github.com/JKubovy/plugin.video.tipsport.elh/issues).

You can watch hockey leagues in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. If you enable "Show all streams" in the settings, you can scroll through all available broadcasts on Tipsport.cz. Unfortunately, not all broadcasts can be played, so this option is not enabled by default.

If the add-on does not work, make sure you have the **InputStream Adaptive** and **RTMP Input** add-ons installed.
